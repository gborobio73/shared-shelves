	  	<h4 class="panel-title">Why this app?</h4>
	  	<div class="panel-body">
	  		I think books are to be read. As I have a lot of them, someone else might want to read those same books as well. Books are expensive here in Finland and the selection of, for example, Spanish books is small. I also think this is a nice way to meet other people.

	  	<h4 class="panel-title">How does this work?</h4>
	  	<div class="panel-body">
	    	You can add your books to the bookshelf by clicking "Add book". Insert the <a href="" ng-click="showImage = !showImage">ISBN</a> (with or without hyphens) and the book information will be imported. Sometimes the information cannot be found but I am constantly working to improve the search.

	    <h4 class="panel-title">What if I am interested in a book?</h4>
	  	<div class="panel-body">
	    	Just click the button "Let the owner know!" and an email will be sent to both you and the owner. You can take it from there.

	    <h4 class="panel-title">What do I do once I have sold a book?</h4>
	  	<div class="panel-body">
	    	Please remove it from the bookshelf, as it is not available anymore.
	  	</div>
	  	<h4 class="panel-title">What do you do with my Google account?</h4>
	  	<div class="panel-body">
	    	It provides a secure way to identify you and to send you emails. Nothing else.

	    	Yep.
